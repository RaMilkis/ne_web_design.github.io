                    Alecsandr Sergeyevich Pushkin. Was born in 1799 in Moscow, and died in 1837. He was famous writer, and his works are known our days.
                    He was one of the most authoritative literary figure in the first third of 19 centery. He was wounded in a duel, and two 
                    days after dead. He was killed by Danteth. I think that if he had survived, he would have written a lot of more interesting story.
